# Ralph Loop: Viral Dominance Protocol

## Mission Statement
Transform lician.com from invisible (11 clicks/month) to the #1 finance destination with 10M+ monthly organic visits through a combination of viral features, 10M+ pSEO pages, visual differentiation, and community-driven network effects.

---

## The Vision: Why This Will Work

### Current State (January 2026)
- **Google Visibility**: 11 clicks/month, avg position 80-100 (invisible)
- **Pages Indexed**: ~2,000 (vs TradingView's 650K+)
- **Unique Advantage**: Lician Score, biotech intelligence, institutional flow - ALL HIDDEN
- **Technical Foundation**: Solid (Next.js 16, Supabase, 50+ API endpoints, 11 data sources)

### Target State (December 2026)
- **Organic Traffic**: 3M+ monthly visits
- **Pages Indexed**: 10M+ programmatic pages
- **Daily Active Users**: 100K+
- **Brand Recognition**: "The Bloomberg for retail investors"

### Why Competitors Are Beatable
1. **TradingView**: Complex, intimidating for beginners
2. **Yahoo Finance**: Boring, no innovation since 2015
3. **Finviz**: Desktop-only, no mobile experience
4. **Simply Wall St**: Expensive ($240/yr), limited to fundamentals
5. **Seeking Alpha**: Paywall hell, $299/yr for useful features
