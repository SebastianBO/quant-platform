### Content Gap Analysis
Identified high-value linkable content opportunities that don't exist yet:

**Statistics Pages (High Link Potential):**
1. `/insights/stock-market-statistics-2026` - Market overview stats, updated daily
2. `/insights/sp500-historical-returns` - S&P 500 annual returns, decade averages
3. `/insights/pe-ratio-by-sector` - Current PE ratios by sector, updated daily
4. `/insights/market-cap-statistics` - Total market cap, largest companies

**Interactive Calculators (High Engagement):**
1. `/calculators/compound-interest` - Investment growth calculator
2. `/calculators/stock-profit` - Buy/sell profit calculator
3. `/calculators/dividend-yield` - Dividend income calculator
4. `/calculators/position-size` - Risk-based position sizing

**Educational Content Gaps:**
1. `/learn/etf-investing` - ETF basics for beginners
2. `/learn/retirement-investing` - 401k, IRA strategies
3. `/learn/options-basics` - Options for beginners
4. `/learn/reading-financial-statements` - How to analyze financials

**Status:** These are content recommendations. Implementation requires creating new pages with unique, valuable content that will attract backlinks.

## Iteration 7 Accomplishments

### Canonical URL Audit
Verified comprehensive canonical URL implementation across all major page types:

- **Homepage**: ✅ `alternates.canonical: SITE_URL`
- **Stock pages** (`/stock/[ticker]`): ✅ Dynamic canonical with lowercase ticker
- **Compare pages** (`/compare/[slugs]`): ✅ Dynamic canonical with lowercase slugs
- **Metric pages** (`/pe-ratio/[ticker]`, etc.): ✅ Hardcoded lician.com canonical
- **Earnings page**: ✅ Hardcoded canonical
- **Screener page**: ✅ Dynamic canonical with query parameters
- **Sector/Industry pages**: ✅ Proper canonicals

**Pattern Used:** Most pages use `alternates: { canonical: url }` in metadata.
Helper function `generateSEOMetadata()` in `src/lib/seo.ts` provides canonical by default.

### Core Web Vitals Configuration
Verified next.config.ts has excellent CWV optimization:

1. **CSS Optimization**: `experimental.optimizeCss: true`
2. **Tree-shaking**: Optimized imports for lucide-react, radix-ui, date-fns, lodash
3. **Image Optimization**:
   - AVIF and WebP formats
   - 30-day minimum cache TTL
   - Device sizes: 640-2048px
   - Image sizes: 16-384px
4. **Caching**:
   - Static assets: 1 year, immutable
   - Fonts: 1 year, immutable
   - robots.txt: 1 day
5. **Font Optimization**: Uses `next/font/google` for Geist font family
6. **Loading States**: Skeleton components exist for chat and home page
7. **Image Components**: StockLogo uses next/image with defined sizes (CLS prevention)

### SEO Redirect
WWW to non-WWW permanent redirect configured for canonical consolidation.

### Additional Findings
- **OG Images**: Dynamic Open Graph images via `/api/og/stock/[ticker]` route
  - Edge runtime for fast generation
  - 1-hour cache TTL
  - Fetches real-time price/change data
- **Error Handling**: `global-error.tsx` exists with reset functionality
- **Minor Recommendation**: No custom `not-found.tsx` (uses Next.js default 404)
  - Could add custom 404 page with internal links for better UX/SEO

---

## Iteration 6 Accomplishments

### robots.txt Configuration
Updated both robots.txt files to include all sitemap declarations:

---

## Iteration 5 Accomplishments

**Compare pages** (`/compare/[slugs]`):
- BreadcrumbList, Article, FAQPage
- Dynamic comparison FAQs

**Screener pages** (`/screener/*`):
- BreadcrumbList, Article, FAQPage, ItemList
- Comprehensive for list pages

**Metric pages** (`/pe-ratio/[ticker]`, etc.):
- BreadcrumbList, Article, Corporation, FAQPage
- 6 dynamic FAQs per page

### Internal Linking Assessment
- RelatedLinks component (746 lines) provides comprehensive cross-linking
- Sector/industry peer mapping for intelligent suggestions

- Sector pages linked via topic clusters

### Key Findings

4. Focus should shift to content creation and backlink acquisition

---

## Iteration 3 Accomplishments

  - `book-value` - common fundamental metric
  - `enterprise-value` - key M&A/valuation metric
